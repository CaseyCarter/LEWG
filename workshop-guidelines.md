# Guidelines for workshop groups in reviewing papers.

Discussed some in c++std-lib-ext-2162.

Select someone to take notes into issue pages so you remember what parts of the papers to point out in the main LEWG review.

Your goal is to get as many papers as possible into a shape that the full LEWG should spend time on them. You have lots of options when reviewing a paper:

* Point out technical problems and iterate with the author to fix them.
* List contentious points in the paper so LEWG can focus on them.
  Try to identify points that anyone on the committee might find contentious.
  Don't try to resolve this sort of issue in your workshop group.
  However, if your group happens to have consensus on an issue you think others will find contentious, point that out.
* Do a line-by-line review of the wording in the paper,
  to make sure that the paper's rationale clearly explains what the wording is trying to do,
  and that the wording accurately reflects the design.
* Recommend that LEWG reject a paper.
* Recommend that LEWG forward a paper to LWG.
  See https://github.com/cplusplus/LEWG/blob/master/paper-checklist.md for goals before we forward a paper.

Your group will lead the LEWG discussion when it comes to LEWG.

Claim a paper to discuss by moving it into your group on https://etherpad.net/p/c++lenexa-lewg.

Look at the previous discussions of a paper, to try to be consistent with previous LEWG straw polls on the issue.
The issue should link to most previous discussions, but there may be some on the mailing list too.

## On having interested people attend workshop groups

It's useful to have people with special knowledge of a paper attend the workshop discussion of the paper.
However, with so much going on at once, it's likely impossible to attend _everything_ you're interested in.
Groups should announce that they're discussing a paper on the meeting IRC channel (irc://chat.freenode.net/##C++-meeting),
look at the issue's CC list for people to invite specifically,
and look at the issue's wiki page for discussion topics people have added before the session.
Don't block on having everyone present, although some reordering is fine.
People who get missed can come to the full-group discussion of the paper.
